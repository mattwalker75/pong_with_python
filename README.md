# pong_with_python
A pong game written in Python because why not

Using AI to help develop a fun Pong game that is fully written in Python.
Why write it in Python?  Because Python is a scripting language that is NOT
intended to be written and used as a game, so we want to see what AI can do
with it.  

Tools used for development:
   - AI
      - ChatGPT
      - Claude Code
   - Developement Tools
      - VSCode 

Python Virtual environment:
   - Setup
       python -m venv pong_venv
   - Start 
       source pong_venv/bin/activate
   - Stop
       deactivate
