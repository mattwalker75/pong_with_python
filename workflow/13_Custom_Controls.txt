Sent the following prompt to Claude to add custom controls to the game:

Lets add the option to map custom controls to the game, for example if 
I want to change the mapping for the first player to use up/down arrows
and the second player to use o/l letters then I can.  Also enable the 
configuration to be different between a single player game and a 2 player
game.  For example, for a single player game, I may want to use the 
up/down arrows to control the paddle, but for a two player game I may
want to have the first player use the w/s keys and the second player
use the up/down arrows.  I want to make that configurable and to save
the configuration in a .cfg file that can be loaded at boot time.  But
if there is no .cfg file, then the game will resort to using default 
control settings and will create a new .cfg file, if custom controls 
are specified.  I want all of this managed in the "SETTINGS" section
on the front page.

Make sure to fully update the documentation highlighting the configurability
and ensure all required unit tests are added and any existing unit tests
are updated as needed.
