I passed the following prompt to ChatGTP to generate a Product 
Requirement Document (PRD):

Help me make a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an app that I 
am vibe coding with Claude Code.  I am going to build the game of Pong 
that can be played locally on a computer.  The following bullets are 
the objectives and guildelines centered around the application.

Program Type:  Game of Pong
Programming Language:  Python
Number of Players: 1 or 2
   NOTE:  If 1 player is selected, then the game should have logic to 
          play the person with increased level of difficulty
Libraries:  Choose the best libraries for the specific tasks and needs.  
            If there are multiple libraries that can perform the task, 
            then you are allowed to consult the Internet to best determine 
            which library to pick
Testing:  All code should have Unit Tests defined with a minimum goal of 
          80% code coverage
Installation:  Track all required libraries in a requirements.txt file 
               that can be installed via the pip command
Documentation:  Provide documentation on how to install, configure ( if 
                appliable ), play, and uninstall the game

You can ask me any needed questions to help think through the application 
to full y build out the PRD document.  Provide the PRD document in a form 
that I can simply copy from here and paste into Claude Code for coding.
