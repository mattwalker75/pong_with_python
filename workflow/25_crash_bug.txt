I passed the following prompt to Claude to fix a bug:

Found a bug.  If you are in the game, and pause it to go into the 
Settings, then you get the following error:

[AUDIO] Error playing background music: [Errno -9986] Internal PortAudio error
python(66032,0x1f0596080) malloc: double free for ptr 0x1471c3a00
python(66032,0x1f0596080) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

I am assuming that is from the audio driver due to the fact that we 
are running with a continuous audio stream instead of constantly 
opening and closing audio streams.  Remember we were experiencing 
cracking in the audio due to the constantly opening and closing of 
audio streams.  So if that is the reason for the error, then I would 
say to just remove the Settings option from the Pause window and only 
leave it in the main window
