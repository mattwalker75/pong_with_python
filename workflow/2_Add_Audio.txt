Sent the following prompt to Claude to add audio to the game:

Looking at the code, it seems like there is audio coded into the game, but
none of the audio is working.  Lets add some audio to the game consisting of
some fun traditional pong "ping" sounds when the ball this a surface or paddle
and lets softly play some 80's vintage arcade-ish music while playing the game.
