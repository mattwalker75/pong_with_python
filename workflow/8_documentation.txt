I passed the following prompt to Claude to enhance code 
documentation:

Look at the code and make sure the code has proper comments.  
Also create a README.md file in the "tests" directory mapping 
out the highlevel test being performed by which file.  
Also create a README.md in the "src" directory mapping 
out what all the code files are for and where they are 
located.   No need to go into a crazy amount of detail in 
either of those README.md files.  Just think of them as 
a roadmap to point developers to where different compontents 
are and what they are used for.
