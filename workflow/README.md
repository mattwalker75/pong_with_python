Workflow that was used to generate this code.

----------------------------

AI Tools used:
  - ChatGPT
     - Use for planning, paperwork, and mockups
  - Claude Code
     - Used for development, coding, and unit testing

This document will cover my interactions with AI to build out this
tool.  It will consist of which AI tools I used for which parts along
with which prompts I passed to the AI.

----------------------------

Setup a virtual environment to work on :
   Python Virtual environment:
      - Setup
         python -m venv pong_venv
      - Start 
         source pong_venv/bin/activate
      - Check which environment you are in
         echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
      - Stop
         deactivate

Below are the workflow that I went through to create the Pong Game:

1:  Create a new repo, download the repo, and create a new branch to work in
2:  Used ChatGPT to create a Product Requirements Document
      - 2_Create_PRD.txt
3:  Generated Product Requirements Document generated by ChatGPT and
    given via copy/paste method to Claude for initial coding
      - PRD.pdf
4:  I let Claude Code write up all the code, which took a little bit..
5:  Wrote some wrapper scripts:
      - INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS.sh
      - RUN_GAME.sh
      - RUN_UNIT_TESTS.sh
6:  Tested the game and created some small tweaks here and there
      - There were errors running the game, so I sent the error messages
        to Claude to resolve
         - Claude determined that the version of a library that I was using
           was newer then expected, so it made the required code modifications
           to resolve
      - There were a few other errors, so I just went through the same
        exercise of copying the error message ( or group of error messages )
        and pasted it to Claude to resolve
7:  Run unit tests and fix any issues with them
      - There were issues due to code changes from bugs being fixed earlier
8:  --  COMITTED THE CODE AND CALLED IT MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) COMPLETE

9:  Adding enhancement to add audio.
      - 9_Add_Audio.txt
10: Verify the game works and audio works.  If it does, then don't forget to
    get Unit Tests generated.  If the audio doesn't work, then continue to
    work with Claude until the audio works like you want and all unit tests
    are working
       - Had some crazy issues due to running on a Mac.  Had to follow
         the following steps to resolve
           - brew install portaudio
           - pip install pyaudio
11: Clean up as you go.  There were a lot of test scripts created and documentation
    generated while working through the audio issues.  Make sure to cleanup
    everything that is no longer needed and review the documents and only 
    keep what you need.
12: --  COMMITED THE CODE AND CALLED THE ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE
