Workflow that was used to generate this code.

----------------------------

AI Tools used:
  - ChatGPT
     - Use for planning, paperwork, and mockups
  - Claude Code
     - Used for development, coding, and unit testing

This document will cover my interactions with AI to build out this
tool.  It will consist of which AI tools I used for which parts along
with which prompts I passed to the AI.

----------------------------

Setup a virtual environment to work on :
   Python Virtual environment:
      - Setup
         python -m venv pong_venv
      - Start 
         source pong_venv/bin/activate
      - Check which environment you are in
         echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
      - Stop
         deactivate

Below are the workflow that I went through to create the Pong Game:

1:  Used ChatGPT to create a Product Requirements Document
      - 1_Create_PRD.txt
2:  Generated Product Requirements Document generated by ChatGPT and
    given via copy/paste method to Claude for initial coding
      - PRD.pdf
3:  I let Claude Code write up all the code, which took a little bit..
4:  Wrote some wrapper scripts:
      - INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS.sh
      - RUN_GAME.sh
      - RUN_UNIT_TESTS.sh
4:  Tested the game and created some small tweaks here and there
      - There were errors running the game, so I sent the error messages
        to Claude to resolve
         - Claude determined that the version of a library that I was using
           was newer then expected, so it made the required code modifications
           to resolve
      - There were a few other errors, so I just went through the same
        exercise of copying the error message ( or group of error messages )
        and pasted it to Claude to resolve
5:  Run unit tests and fix any issues with them
      - There were issues due to code changes from bugs being fixed earlier
