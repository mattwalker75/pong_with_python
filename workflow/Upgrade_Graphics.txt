I passed the following prompt along with the mock_up.png image file
to ChatGTP to generate the proper prompt that can be given to 
Claude along with the image to upgrade the graphics of the PONG game:

I am writting a Pong game in python 3.13.x that is utilizing the
"arcade" 3.3.3 library for graphics.  Can you write a prompt that
I can give to Claude along with the attached image file to perform
an upgrade of the visuals of the pong game.  I want it to add some 
fun 3d effects, such as motion blur of the ball and some shadowing
to provide the illusion of 3d.  I love the background and would like
something similar to be played on.  Use this theme throughout 
the whole game, including menu system and front screen of the game.

My next step will consist of taking the generated prompt along with
the image and uploading it to Claude so it can perform the coding.
