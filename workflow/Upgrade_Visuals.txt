I passed the following prompt to ChatGTP to generate a visual mockup
that can be used as inspiration to give to Claude to upgrade the
visuals of the Pong game:

I am writting a Pong game in python 3.13.x that is utilizing the
"arcade" 3.3.3 library for graphics.  Can you mockup some graphical images
of a Pong game that could be graphically rendored using the 
"arcade" library within the game.  I want to add some fun 3d 
effects, such as motion blur of the ball and some shadowing to 
provide the illusion of 3d.  have the game played on a fun retro
backdrop.  

Generate multiple pictures that I can choose from.  I will want to
be able to take one of the images and upload it to Claude to use
for programming.
